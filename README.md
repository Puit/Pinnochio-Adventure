Game Developed for a Game Jam

I developed this game for the Community Game Jam 2019, where the participants had to develop a game in 7 days on the theme "The game is a liar".
 Controls:
      - A to go left
      - D to go right
      - Space to jump and go to next dialog
      - Left mouse button to attack
